This might be a continuous topic. I'm learning AngularJS and there are a few things about it that caused some serious WTFs. I'm writing this stuff down to (hopefully) remember it. So here it goes.

### Test output
Ok, this is actually not specific to AngularJS but to Karma/Jasmine. Whenever a test fails due to an unavailable function you get a message like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'element('form').submit()')
{% endhighlight %}


Remember: It's the last mentioned function that's ```undefined```! So in this case it is the ```submit``` function.

### binding('binding-name') doesn't work with two-way-databindings
Calling ```binding()``` on a two-way-databinding (like ```ng-model="binding-name"```) throws an error message that says ```Binding selector 'binding-name' did not match.```. I don't know the reason. Maybe I'll get an explanation on my [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18630723/why-doesnt-binding-find-a-two-way-binding-in-an-e2e-test).

### Custom Jasmine matchers in E2E tests ([source](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/angular/lcFXW8uv_P8/3gekqCrzSnEJ))
Writing custom matchers in E2E tests differs from the standard [Jasmine way](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Matchers#writing-new-matchers).

{% highlight javascript %}
angular.scenario.matcher('toBeReallyReallyTrue', function() {
  return this.actual === true;
});
{% endhighlight %}

### Using [ngmin](https://github.com/btford/ngmin): Know the conventions!
If you're using [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) to generate your AngularJS project you're probably making use of [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to build everything. The default build configuration runs ```ngmin``` for pre-minification of your script files. That means you will have to stick to some conventions for writing controllers, services, filters etc. Take a look at ```ngmin```. This is what I ran into:

I defined a controller by hand like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function MainCtrl ($scope, $routeParams) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

and it got minfied to

{% highlight javascript %}
function MainCtrl (a, b) {
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

This breaks AngularJSs' Depedency Injection. So I had to rewrite this to:

{% highlight javascript %}
angular.module('phvApp').controller('MainCtrl', ['$scope', '$routeParams', function ($scope, $routeParams) {
  ...
}]);
{% endhighlight %}

### Two-way-databinding automatically generates a model if it does not exist
Not just useful, especially when debugging:

{% highlight javascript %}
...
$scope.firstname = 'Alice';
...
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<input type="text" ng-model="firstName" />
{% endhighlight %}

### Trigger jQuery events in a custom dsl ([source](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/752))
I wanted to e2e test a directive which shows and hides another element when hovering over the directive's element. I wrote a custom dsl to trigger the ```mouseover``` event on a given element. But the event didn't seem to fire inside the e2e tests although it worked in the browser. Here is the code:

{%highlight html %}
<span class="master" show-hide=".slave">...</span>
<span class="slave">...</span>
{% endhighlight %}

The e2e test looked like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
angular.scenario.dsl('mouseover', function() {
  return function(selector) {
    return this.addFutureAction('Calling mouseover of given element', function($window, $document, done) {
      $document.find(selector).trigger('mouseover');
      done();
    });
  };
});

...

it('should show slave', function() {
  expect(element('.slave').css('display')).toBe('none');
  
  mouseover('.master');

  expect(element('.slave').css('display')).not().toBe('none');
});
{% endhighlight %}

The problem is with using jQuery in the custom dsl. What I understood so far is that angular's Scenario Runner runs your app in an iFrame which lies inside a main frame. The main frame has jQuery available, as the Scenario Runner depends on it. So I thought there were no restrictions in using jQuery in a custom dsl. However, the outer jQuery instance cannot bubble up events inside the DOM of the iFrame. So calling ```trigger``` with my custom dsl had no effect inside the iFrame.

Here is what made it work:

{% highlight javascript %}
angular.scenario.dsl('mouseover', function() {
  return function(selector) {
    return this.addFutureAction('Calling mouseover of given element', function($window, $document, done) {
      var elements = $window.angular.element($document.elements());
      elements.trigger('mouseover');
      done();
    });
  };
});
{% endhighlight %}
